# WordInfoExtractor
WordInfoExtractor is a Python tool that reads a list of words from a CSV and uses OpenAI's GPT to extract the part of speech, meaning, and example sentence for each word. The results are saved in an Excel file, making it a useful tool for enhancing vocabulary datasets or language learning projects.
